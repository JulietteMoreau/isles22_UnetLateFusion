def dc(result, reference):
    r"""
    Dice coefficient

    Computes the Dice coefficient (also known as Sorensen index) between the binary
    objects in two images.

    The metric is defined as

    .. math::

        DC=\frac{2|A\cap B|}{|A|+|B|}

    , where :math:`A` is the first and :math:`B` the second set of samples (here: binary objects).

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : array_like
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.
    reference : array_like
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.

    Returns
    -------
    dc : float
        The Dice coefficient between the object(s) in ```result``` and the
        object(s) in ```reference```. It ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect overlap).

    Notes
    -----
    This is a real metric. The binary images can therefore be supplied in any order.
